        ": Astronomy, a captivating blend of science and human curiosity, explores the vast expanse of celestial objects, the mysteries of space, and the entirety of our physical universe. This field of study has a rich and storied history that dates back to the earliest civilizations, reflecting our innate desire to comprehend the world that surrounds us.\n",
        "\n",
        ": In the 3rd century BCE, Greek astronomers like Galileo Galilei introduced groundbreaking methods that substantiated the heliocentric model, reshaping our understanding of the universe. \n",

        ": Everything in the sky is constantly moving, and, for those who are interested in astronomy, a tool to look up locations of celestial objects would be useful.

For more casual fans, we want to include information about events that can be seen with the naked eye - blue moons, eclipses, meteor showers, etc. Giving information on when and where they‚Äôre next predicted to happen could be useful for anyone who likes to stargaze.\n",

We planned for the user to input their birthdate and be able to receive information on their sun sign, any planet movements affecting their sign, and other astrology considerations. However, this would've added much more complexity to our database. So, we decided to remove this functionality.\n",

There's also Altitude and Azimuth coordinates, which, given two set of longitude and latitude and the time, or celestial coordinates and the time, you're able to get the angle and direction you'd have to look to see a celestial body/event. It's a bit of a complex calculation, and we're unsure if performance would be better having a query calculate it or creating another table.\n",
